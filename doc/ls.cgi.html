<h1> The <tt>ls.cgi</tt> internal program </h1>

<p>
 <tt>ls.cgi</tt> is a binary that is suitable for using as a CGI script,
e.g. called <tt>index.cgi</tt>,
in a Web document hierarchy served by tipidee, when the goal of the index
file is only to list the contents of the directory it resides in.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     ls.cgi
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> It is not meant to be invoked by users. It will fail if invoked outside of a
CGI script context. As such, it is unexported (it will appear in <tt>libexecdir</tt>,
not in <tt>bindir</tt>). </li>
 <li> It is meant to be placed in the repository of CGI scripts and symlinked as
<tt>index.cgi</tt> in the places where the URL of a directory should list the
contents of said directory. </li>
 <li> For instance, if <tt>example.com:443/index.cgi</tt> is a copy of, or a
symlink to, ls.cgi, and the tipidee configuration says that this binary is meant
to be a CGI script, then access to <tt>https://example.com</tt> will list the files
available in the <tt>example.com:443/</tt> directory. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Exit codes </h2>

<dl>
 <dt> 0 </dt> <dd> success </dd>
 <dt> 100 </dt> <dd> wrong usage </dd>
 <dt> 111 </dt> <dd> system call failed </dd>
</dl>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> ls.cgi is very minimalistic. It provides no CSS or anything else than
the bare list of files. It is provided as an example of how CGI scripts can
work with tipidee. </li>
</ul>
